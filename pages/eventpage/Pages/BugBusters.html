        BUG-BUSTERS is a dynamic and challenging code debugging event designed to test participants' programming
        prowess,
        problem-solving skills, and time management. This event aims to engage and foster teamwork among participants,
        allowing them to showcase their debugging abilities under time constraints.

          <span><b>Round 1: Preliminary Round - "Code Crunch":</b></span>
          <li>Each team should contain 2 members.</li>
          <li>The scheduled activity will span a duration
            of 45 minutes with the primary objective of assessing participants' initial debugging skills.</li>
          <li>The plan involves distributing diverse code snippets to each team, who will be tasked with identifying and
            resolving
            as many issues as possible within the allocated time frame.</li>
          <li>Success in this phase will determine the top-performing
            teams based on their adept debugging capabilities. </li>
          <li>Those teams demonstrating a superior number of correct debugs
            will advance to the subsequent round of the competition.</li>

          <li>In this final phase, the selected finalists will encounter a more challenging set of
            code snippets carefully designed to test both individual and collaborative debugging skills. </li>
          <li> Teams are required
            to strategically approach each problem during rotations, aiming to maximize their efficiency in
            problem-solving. </li>
          <li> The determining factor for declaring the BUG-BUSTERS champions will be the team with the highest
            number of correctly debugged problems in 60 min, with tiebreaker criteria applied if necessary. </li>

     <span><b>Round 1 : Idea Submission</b></span>
     We are open to all aspiring entrepreneurs from all colleges,participants can submit their
     groundbreaking ideas as an abstract.We're looking for projects that can make a positive
     impact,from sustainable solutions to tech innovations.Expert judges evaluate submissions
     based on creativity,feasibility and Novelty.The top teams will advance to the next round.

        <span><b>Round 2 : Facing the Sharks</b></span>
        The selected teams present their ideas lively to a group of experienced entrepreneurs,"the
sharks".During the pitch,the participants will present their "product idea" with their prototype (low
or medium fidelity) and what makes their product unique and valuable to the Sharks.The sharks
evaluate and make investment offers to the ideas and the best product is selected.It is a high
energy competition where each team's fate is at stake.

        <div class="rules">
          <li><b>Team Composition:</b> Participants must form teams of two, and only one member can debug at a time.
          </li>
          <li><b>Team Rotation: </b>Swap roles every 5 minutes to ensure fair distribution of responsibilities and
            effective communication. </li>
          <li><b>Scoring Criteria:</b> Teams will be evaluated based on the number of successfully
            debugged problems, with a tiebreaker favoring faster completion. </li>
          <li> <b>Debugging Environment: </b>Participants receive pre-loaded code snippets with deliberate errors to
            debug within the specified time frame. </li>
          <li> <b>Communication: </b>Teams can communicate only during the designated rotation period, with no
            communication allowed outside that timeframe. </li>

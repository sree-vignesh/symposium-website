        The Design Dynamo Challenge is an exhilarating design competition
        where teams face the unexpected "Mystery Roulette." After receiving a
        prototype developed in Round 1, teams must swiftly adapt to a randomly
        assigned twist. The challenge demands lightning-speed creativity,
        adaptability, and design ingenuity.
